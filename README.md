# Sonobabble [![Build Status][travis badge]][travis]
A social network for sound

## Why?
Every day, billions of people communicate using the same tool: the spoken word.
And yet [all][facebook] [the][twitter] [major][instagram] [social][reddit]
[networks][snapchat] focus on pictures and text.

It’s time for a change.

It’s time for Sonobabble, the first social network made for sound.

## How?
Although Sonobabble is still in development, it is being worked on in
[Golang][golang] (along with HTML).

## When?
I have no idea. I’m hoping for [March 31, 2017][march 31 2017 timer] (maybe?).

## Who?
Me, primarily. If you somehow stumbled here and want to make a pull request, go
ahead! Ensure that you have [Gorilla Mux][gorilla mux] installed.
